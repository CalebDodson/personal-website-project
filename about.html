      <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a classically trained musician turned web developer with a passion for creating harmony and art in both my music and my code and design.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a musician, I've honed my skills and abilities to be able to perform and compete internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few of these skills are discipline, attention to detail, and a commitment to learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, performing music requires patience, precision, and the ability to see how every small part fits into a large whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;I approach my work as a web developer in the same manner as I approach preparing for a performance with the foremost goal of giving my audience a meaningful and impactful experience.
